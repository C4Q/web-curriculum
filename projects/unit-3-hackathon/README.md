# Goal
This weekend will be the start of our first hackathon! You will have one week (projects will be demoed in front of the class on Friday, October 14th) to complete a project of your choosing. It is up to you what you'd like to do, but try to aim for something that you can realistically complete in a week. Also keep in mind that you'll also want to eventually put this in your portfolio, so try to make something that you'd be OK to show to potential employers.

# Requirements
- One project per person - everyone will be working individually. You are welcome to talk to your classmates to get advice and feedback, but ultimately everyone should have their own, individual project.
- EVERYONE will demo their project on Friday, October 14th. You will have a short amount of time (exact time limit will be decided next week, but will be somewhere in the 2-4 minute range) to show how your project works and talk about your challenges and highlights. Presentations do not need to be formal (in other words, you do not need a power point or any other formal presentation materials) but should be polished and professional. Even if your project is broken or buggy you will still be expected to demo and talk about your process, progress, and challenges.
- You must use React in your project. You are not required to use Redux but you'll probably find that it will help you - this is a good opportunity to practice Redux in a bigger app. All other technical choices are up to you.
- You must start from scratch. Do not build off of previous projects.

# Schedule
- Monday is mandatory attendance. You will have most of the day to work on your projects, but we will also have some meetings to discuss your plan and strategy. There will also be some information on Bash.
- It is up to you where you work on Tuesday the 18th. You are welcome to come into C4Q - there will be staff here to assist you with your projects if needed. However you are not required to come in, and can work from home if you'd like.
- C4Q will be closed on Wednesday the 19th. Take the day to work from home!
- Thursday is back to mandatory attendance. We will be have one on ones starting at 10 AM on Thursday to discuss your projects and give advice/feedback. Come in on time. If you miss your scheduled one on one because you are late, you will not be able to reschedule, and we will not be happy.
- Friday is also mandatory attendance. Everyone will demo their project on Friday October 21st, starting at 10 am.

# Prizes
- Prizes will be awarded for three categories:
  1. Best use of Redux (whoever most effectively and elegantly uses Redux in their app)
  2. Mad scientist (crazy project idea that has no practical purpose but is also kind of ingenious)
  3. People's Choice (class vote for the best overall project)

The winner of the People's Choice award will win a Raspberry Pi!

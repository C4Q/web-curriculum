# Grocery List / Or Pokemon List =)
Make a simple to-do-list web app using jQuery that helps you track of what groceries you want to buy.


### Instructions
- Create a new folder called "jquery-grocery-list"
- Add an `index.html` file to your folder (this is where you'll be adding your HTML)
- Add an `app.js` file to your folder (this is where you'll be adding your jQuery code)
- Add `body` tags to your HTML file
- Add `script` tags in yout HTML file to link in both the jQuery library file and your `app.js` file (you'll need two separate `script` tags). You can use the following tag for jQuery: `<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.1.0/jquery.min.js"></script>`
- Set up an empty `<ul>` in the `<body>` to insert stuff into. 
- Set up an `<input>` tag with type text to type what you want to add. 
- Create a button called 'Add Item' - clicking the button will add the value from your input field into your list. 
- Add the functionality (using jQuery) to append items to your list after your click the 'Add Item' button. You'll need to create a new node that contains the value you typed into the input box, then append that new node to your list


**CHALLENGE**: updated your app so that when you double click on an item it's removed from the list

**CHALLENGE**: add prioritiy levels (for example, number your items 1-5 with 1 being the highest priority and 5 being lowest) and add in a button that, when clicked, will sort your list according to priority

**CHALLENGE**: add a 'Search' input box that will filter your list depending on what you type in

**CHALLENGE**: style your app (using CSS) to make it look better

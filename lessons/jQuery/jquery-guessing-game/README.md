##Setup
- Create a new folder
- Add an `index.html` file, `app.js` file, and `main.css` file to your folder
- Add in a script tag to your html file to load in your `app.js` file
- Add in a script tag to yout html file to load in jQuery
- Test your files to make sure everything is setup correctly. You should put all of your javascript and jQuery code into the `app.js` file

##Create a simple guessing game. Your app should:
- generate a random number (that is hidden from the player) that the player will try to guess
- allow a player to type a number guess into an input box
- allow up to 5 guesses
- inform the player if they guess correctly
- inform the player if they have run out of guesses
- allow the player to click a button to reset the game and start over

##Bonuses:
- BONUS: show the previous guesses to the user, so they know what they've already guessed 
- BONUS: inform the user whether their previous guess is too high or too low
- BONUS: prevent players from entering non-valid input. In other words, prevent players from entering anything other than a number between 1 and 100
- BONUS: add a button that will give the user a hint (for example, a range of numbers that they should guess between)
- BONUS: give the player a 'prize' if they win. For example, you can show them a GIF or picture as a reward for guessing correctly. Or you can have a fake set of prizes and randomly award one to winners
- BONUS: style your app (using CSS)

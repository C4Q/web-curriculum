# Grocery List / Or Pokemon List =)
Make a simple to-do-list web app that helps you track of what groceries you want to buy.


### Instructions
1) Set up an empty `<ul>` in the `<body>` to insert stuff into. <br>
2) Set up an `<input>` tag with type text to type what you want to add. <br>
3) Create a `<select>` tag with `<option>` tags to sort items into different categories. <br>
4) Create a button tag with the attribute/value of onClick="addGrocery();" - clicking the button will call the function `addGrocery` defined in your `<script>` tag. <br>
5) Save the `ul` element you want to alter in a variable. <br>
6) Create the `li` element you want to insert into the `ul`. <br>
7) Access the `value` of the input text. <br>
8) Create a textNode with the `value`. <br>
9) Start appending things into each other!

**CHALLENGE: see if you can get your list to persist through refreshes using window.localStorage** <br>

**EXTRA CHALLENGE: add a checkbox next to an item - when clicked, puts a line-through the item to indicate that you bought it!**

# Todo List
Make a simple to-do-list web app that helps you track your todos.


### Instructions
For an extra challenge, try making this entire app without writing anything except for a `<body></body>` tag in your HTML file. In other words, try to use DOM methods to add every single element and attribute onto the page.

1) Set up an empty `<ul>` in the `<body>` to insert stuff into. <br>
2) Set up an `<input>` tag with type text to type what you want to add. <br>
3) Create a button tag with the test 'Add Item.' When clicked, the button should add whatever text you have in the `input` box as a `li` item to your todo list.



**CHALLENGE**: updated your app so that when you double click on an item it's removed from the list

**CHALLENGE**: add priority levels (for example, number your items 1-5 with 1 being the highest priority and 5 being lowest) and add in a button that, when clicked, will sort your list according to priority

**CHALLENGE**: Create a `<select>` tag with `<option>` tags to sort items into different categories. <br>

**CHALLENGE**: add a 'Search' input box that will filter your list depending on what you type in

**CHALLENGE**: add a checkbox next to an item - when clicked, puts a line-through the item to indicate that you bought it!

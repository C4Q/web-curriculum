##Setup
- Create an index.html file that just has an empty <body></body> tag in it
- Create an `app.js` file in the same folder
- Add a `<script>` tag to your index.html file and link in your `app.js` file
- Open your index.html file up in Chrome. It should just be a blank page

##Exercises
Do not edit your HTML file for any of these exercises. You should put all of your code in your `app.js` file. Only use DOM methods:
- Create a new 'div' element
- Add a 'main-div' id to your div element (you can use the [`setAttribute`](http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_element_setattribute.asp) method)
- Append the new div element to the document.body
- Create a new `p` element
- Add some text to your paragraph. The text can say whatever you want.
- Append the `p` to the ``'main-div'``. Reload your index.html page and you should see your paragraph, with the text in it
- Create a `button` element
- Add some text to your new button.
- Append the button to the ``'main-div'``. Reload your index.html page and you should see your two button and paragraph.
- Create another `p` element.
- Add some text to the new `p` element
- Append the new `p` to your 'main-div', underneath the button
- Add the class `'paragraph-text'` to both of your `p` elements
- Create an `ol` (ordered-list) element
- Append the `ol` element to the main div
- Create five separate `li` (list) items
- Append the `li` items to the `ol`
- Add the class `'list-item'` to each of the `li` elements
- Add the `id` 'main-list' to the `ol`

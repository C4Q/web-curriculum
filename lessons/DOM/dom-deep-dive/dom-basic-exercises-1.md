##Setup
- Create an index.html file that just has an empty <body></body> tag in it
- Open your index.html file up in Chrome. It should just be a blank page

##Exercises
Do not edit your HTML file for any of these exercises. Only use DOM methods:
- Create a new 'div' element
- Add a 'main-div' id to your div element (you can use the [`setAttribute`](http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_element_setattribute.asp) method)
- Append the new div element to the document.body
- Create a new `button` element
- Add some text to your button. The text can say whatever you want.
- Append the button to the ``'main-div'``. Reload your index.html page and you should see your button, with the text in it
- Create another `button` element
- Add some text to your new button. The text should be different than the first button.
- Append the second button to the ``'main-div'``. Reload your index.html page and you should see your two buttons.
- Add the class `'btn'` to both of your buttons
- Create an `ul` (unordered-list) element
- Append the `ul` element to the main div
- Create three separate `li` (list) items
- Append the `li` items to the `ul`
- Add the class `'list-item'` to each of the `li` elements
- Add the `id` 'main-list' to the `ul`

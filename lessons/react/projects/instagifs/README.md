The goal is to create a simple instagram style app that only displays GIFs. At this time we'll just start to build the very basic parts of the app, and will keep building on it in the future.  

## Intructions
- Create a 'Gif' component to display a Gif. Each component should have an `img` tag that contains a GIF.
- Create a 'User' component. The componenet should contain a profile pic, a username, and a short 1 sentence description
- Create a 'Comments' component
- Create a 'Likes' component that lets the user hit a heart button, and displays the current number of likes
- Create a 'UserPage' component that contains a User and some Gifs
- Create a 'Feed' component that contains GIFs from different users
- Create a navbar component. The navbar should have a link for 'Home', 'Add', and 'Discover', which will eventually link to different pages

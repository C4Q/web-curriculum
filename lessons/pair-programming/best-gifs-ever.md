###Question
Image you're in charge of creating a new website called "Best GIFs ever." Like the name implies, the purpose of the website is to display the best GIFs ever. 

You're given a [really simple template](https://repl.it/CcYW) to start from (click the `Run` button on repl.it to see it in action), but the rest is up to you. Decide how you want to structure your site, how you'd like it to look, and what content you'd like on it, and then start actually building it. 

Feel free to keep building on top of the template, or go in a completely different direction. You can do things like change the structure, change the style, add different sections for different types of GIFs, add buttons, add links, add more GIFs, and basically anything else you can think of. 

Don't worry if you get stuck or if you come across things that you're not sure how to do. Just try your best! The goal isn't to build a perfect website - the goal is to get some experience with pair programming and to have some fun.

To get started, start a new [HTML, CSS, JS project on repl.it](https://repl.it/languages/web_project). If you'd like to use the template as a foundation, copy and paste the content from the `index.js` and `index.css` files from the [template](https://repl.it/CcYW) into your own repl.it session. Please do not edit the template project.

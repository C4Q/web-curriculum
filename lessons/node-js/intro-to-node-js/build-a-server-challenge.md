# Setup
- Create a new folder
- Add an `app.js` file

# Instructions
1. Read over the following:
- [Eloquent Javascript (read the 'A Simple File Server' section)](http://eloquentjavascript.net/20_node.html)
- [Build your first server](http://blog.modulus.io/build-your-first-http-server-in-nodejs)

2. Use the `http` module to create a basic server in your `app.js` file. Be sure to `require` in the `http` module at the top of your file

3. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8080` (you may have to change '8080', aka the port number, to whatever you specify in your server) and you should see your app up and running, if its working

4. Can you add a server to some of your prior projects?

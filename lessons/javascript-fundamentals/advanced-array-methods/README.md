#Lecture
##What is programming?

- At its core, programming is about taking in some input and transforming it into ouput
- However it can get really complex - in fact, programming is the most complex thing that humans do
- Good programming is about simplifying complexity
- We spend most of our time fixing mistakes and doing maintenance

##Style
- [Douglas Crockford Talk On Style](https://youtu.be/_EANG8ZZbRs?t=23m22s) (watch until 26:00)
**Discussion:** What's the importance of style? How do we know what's good style and what's bad style?

##Intro to advanced array methods
Array methods are a really powerful tool in JavaScript. Specifically, methods like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` make solving certain problems (for example, a lot of problems that we've previously been using loops to solve) a lot easier. Let's learn how they work!

##Abstraction
In the context of programming, abstractions hide details and give us the ability to talk about problems at a higher (or more abstract) level. What are some examples of abstractions within JavaScript?

##Pure vs impure functions
Read over the following: [Pure vs Impure Functions](http://www.nicoespeon.com/en/2015/01/pure-functions-javascript/)

- What's the difference between a pure and an impure function?
- What's the importance of purity?
- Does every function need to be pure?

###Demo: Advanced array methods part 1
Read [this article](http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_array.asp) to find the definitions of the below methods, and try to define what each is used for. What is the purpose of passing in a function as an argument to each of these functions?

- `sort` 
- `reverse`
- `every`
- `some

###Demo: Advanced array methods part 2
Again look over [this article](http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_array.asp) to find the definitions of the below methods, and try to define what each is used for. What makes these functions different from things like `for` loops and `while` loops? What are the advantages and disadvantages of using them instead of loops?

- `forEach`
- `filter`
- `map`
- `reduce`

# Object Oriented Programming with ES6 Classes

## Data Modeling
The main idea behind object oriented program is to create data 'models' (aka abstractions, classes, objects) that represent objects or concepts.

For example, you can create a class to represent all of the functionality and properties of a robot.

Similarly, you can create a class to represent the functionality of a drone.

The idea is that the class replicates all of the real functionality and properties of these actual objects.

## ES6 Classes

**CHALLENGE:** Create an 'autonomous-car' class. It should extend the robot class. In addition to the Robot class properties and methods, it should also have:

- a `fuel` property that tracks how much fuel the car has
- a `drive` method that logs out that the car is driving, and updates its current location
- a `park` method that logs out the name of the car and that it is now parked

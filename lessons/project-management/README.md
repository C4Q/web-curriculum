# Intro to Agile Software Development

## Agile Core principles:
- Flexibility and incremental changes (short feedback loop)
- Efficient, face-to-face communication
- Working software is the best measure of progress (and also the best sales tool)
- Continuous communication with client/customer

## Incremental changes
While in traditional project management different phases of the project are typically split up into different blocks of time, in agile software development you are constantly and continuously analyzing, testing, and coding.

Essentially, the goal of agile is to take constant, baby-steps forward, so you can check and test every step of the way and easily change your plans if needed.

## MVP

'MVP' stands for 'Minimum Viable Product'. When building a product using agile methodology, you will typically start by outlining an MVP that you will aim to build as a team.


An MVP is basically the bare bones, most basic version of your product, that has just the core features needed to sufficiently deploy and test a product. In other words, your MVP should be functional and usable, but should ONLY have the core features that are absolutely necessary for your product.

MVPs need to have a general overview, but do not need to have all the details. Typically, creating a wireframe (or something similar) is perfectly acceptable for MVPs; you do not need a full design, or even a full plan for every feature of your product.

Building out an MVP before the rest of the product helps you test ideas and assumptions before the product gets to market. In other words, an MVP lets you quickly and efficiently test your product before its too late to make major changes.

You need to figure out if anyone actually wants your product before you commit to spending a lot of time on it!

**Discussion:** what would a Reddit MVP look like?

## Sprints
After outlining your MVP, you then break your project into 'sprints'. A sprint is typically a two week period (but can really be as long or as short as your team decides) where you try to complete a certain amount of features.

At the beginning of each sprint, your team will get together and decide which features to try to complete during the sprint. You'll then meet daily with your team during the sprint to check on progress. Once the sprint is completed, you get back together with your team and start a new one.

Here are the typical steps involved in a sprint:

- Create a list of all potential new features, bug fixes, and refactoring (aka a 'backlog')
- Estimate how long each feature will take
- Prioritize features
- Assign features to different team members
- Organize all of your features and estimates using project management software (like [waffle.io](https://waffle.io/))
- Start coding
- Update and track progress as you go using your project management software and daily standups

## Daily standup
An important part of the agile process is the 'daily standup', which is basically just a short (10 - 15 minute) daily meeting with your team to have some face-to-face time to dicuss progress and daily goals.

Typically, during a daily standup each member of the team should briefly discuss the following:

- Progress since last standup
- Priorities for the day
- Any blocking features or impediments
